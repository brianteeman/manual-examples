com_ajaxdemo
============

This is an example component which demonstrates the use of [Ajax in components](https://manual.joomla.org/docs/general-concepts/javascript/ajax),
and can easily be adapted to provide demonstrations of using [com_ajax](https://manual.joomla.org/docs/general-concepts/javascript/com-ajax) for other types of extensions.

See [Ajaxdemo Component](https://manual.joomla.org/docs/building-extensions/components/component-examples/ajaxdemo) in the Joomla Manual
for a detailed description of how to use it.
